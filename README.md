# Implemented a video game, using Java and Swing.
The game is implemented on full screen, it has a menu with 4 buttons, new game, resume game, options and exit, all of them are responsive.
Our player, the little knight, can move using WASD and arrows keys. You can go back to the menu by pressing ESC.
The game images are kept in 2 spritesheets, in general a Tile is generated on a 16*16 dimension.
The menu has a scary sound, I'm still working with the gameplay sounds.
There is an algorithm that is writing the FPS(frames per second).

# here is a photo of the menu
